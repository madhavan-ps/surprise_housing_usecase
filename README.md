## General Information
Surprise Housing, a US-based Company has decided to enter Australian market. The company aims to use data driven analytics to purchase houses at price below their actual value and then sell for a higher price.

2. Determine the Actual Price of the house/property
3. How well these variables/features, drives/derives the price of house/property

## Conclusions
- House/property Quality,Living area,Garage capacity, neighborhood are the Key drivers/features in determining the price.
- Lasso Regression model is the best suited for this usecase
